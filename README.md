# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview

This project is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) implemented in Java. The system is designed to monitor network traffic and identify potential security breaches by comparing network traffic against a set of predefined rules.

## Features

- Real-time network traffic monitoring
- Detection of known attack signatures
- Customizable rule set for detection
- Logging and alerting of suspicious activities

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core functionality of the NIDS is implemented in Java.
- **JNETPCAP** : The main library that manages to capture and decode packets.
